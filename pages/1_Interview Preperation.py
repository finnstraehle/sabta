- **Clarify the problem:** Ask questions to ensure you understand the objective and constraints.
- **Structure your approach:** Break down the problem using a top-down or hypothesis-driven approach (MECE principle).
- **Use issue trees:** Identify key drivers (e.g. profit = revenue - cost) and branch into sub-components (fixed vs variable costs, price vs volume).
- **Support with data:** Interpret charts or numbers by noting top-level trends and outliers before drawing conclusions.
- **Stay MECE and logical:** Make sure your breakdown is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
- **Summarize and check:** Restate your final answer and confirm it addresses the main question.
- **Be hypothesis-driven:** Start with a likely solution path and confirm or adjust it as you gather information.
- **Quantify assumptions:** Attach rough numbers or percentages to ideas to make analysis concrete.
